# TaylorSeriesExpansion
Swift Playground for a Taylor Series Expansion for e^3 up to the order 5th order polynomial, when x = 3. Also note, for the sake of calculation I set e equal to it's approximate decimal value, 2.71828, so it could be calculated.

Please note, I am not a mathematician. I just seen a reference to the Taylor Series on Twitter one day and was inspired to create this Playground.  Please submit a pull request if I have an error.

Inspiration for this equation used in this Playground came from this Khan Academy video about the Taylor Series Expansion:
